# Welcome!

Welcome to my personal website. I am a research assistant at the <a href="http://datasearch.uom.lk/2/index.php"> DataSEARCH research center</a>, Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), University of Moratuwa. I have completed my Master's research degree at the Dept of CSE in the theme of intelligent transportation systems with a focus on improving public transportation service in Sri Lanka. My research encompasses predictive modelling of bus arrival times through advanced machine learning paradigms like <span style="color:#61B886;"> spatio-temporal forecasting, meta-learning, ensemble learning and explainable AI </span>. At present, my primary research emphasis lies on spatio-temporal data (e.g. GPS) processing and <span style="color:#61B886;"> mathematical modelling of trajectories </span> of bus trips. I am actively involved in exploring various modelling methods and improving the prediction accuracy and hence, reliability. Through my work, I endeavour to contribute to the enhancement of public transportation systems in my country. By utilising advanced machine learning techniques and computational methods, I strive to unearth new insights and potential applications of advanced machine learning techniques in spatio-temporal data, ultimately fostering a more reliable public transits.
