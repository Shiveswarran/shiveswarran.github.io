# Welcome!

I am a postgraduate student at the University of Moratuwa, pursuing a Master's research project in the exploration and characterisation of coal fly ash, a waste material, with a focus on advancing material usage. My research encompasses mineral processing through separation technology, material synthesis and characterisation, machine learning, and digital image processing. At present, my primary research emphasis lies in <span style="color:#1DA6DB;">computational X-ray microanalysis</span> and its applications for materials at the nano- and micron-scale. I am actively involved in <span style="color:#1DA6DB;">simulations and computational decision-making processes</span> aimed at characterising nano and micron materials derived from coal fly ash. Through my work, I endeavour to contribute to the scientific understanding of coal fly ash as a valuable resource for sustainable material development. By utilising advanced analytical techniques and computational methods, I strive to unearth new insights and potential applications for this waste material, ultimately fostering a more environmentally conscious approach.
