  abstract: "The demand for minerals is rapidly increasing with industrialization, urbanization, and population growth. Sri Lanka has the potential to penetrate the world market with its endowed rich base of minerals despite its small land area. However, selecting a suitable mining method and its optimum utilization have significant roles in the growth of the local mineral mining industry. The lack of systematic approaches in mining methods is suboptimal for the economic growth of Sri Lanka, which demands immediate investigation and reassessment of contemporary mining practices. Thus, this study aims to critique the major mining practices and evaluate their suitability through characteristics and numerical analysis. This investigation was performed for underground mining methods, cut-and-fill stoping and open-stoping; surface mining methods, open-pit, and open-cast placer mining with reference to Bogala, Kahatagaha, Aruwakkalu, and Pulmoddai, respectively. A detailed study complying with the principles of the grounded theory was conducted through a multimethod approach followed by a thematic and content analysis along with the deductive approach. Moreover, the suitability of these methods was evaluated employing the University of British Columbia method through a numerical approach. This study reveals that the selections of mining methods are appropriate for all four mines, and mining practices are modernized and traditional, complying with site-specific requirements."

  abstract: "A comprehensive study for utilizing multispectral satellite imagery to enhance novel environmental monitoring techniques is crucial in terms of accuracy, processing time, and cost for a sustainable triple bottom. The accurate classification of water bodies from other features optimizes spatiotemporal analysis to address global challenges. Therefore, this study emerges as the new research frontier in proposing an apt algorithm for recognizing water resources and coastline in Sri Lanka. This study explores the potential of using classification algorithms for geospatial assessments and applications with their accuracy and reliability. The acquired Collection 2 Level 2 Landsat 8 imagery was geometrically and radiometrically pre-processed, and a false-colour composite was produced from the bands, short-wave infrared, red and near-infrared. A total of 280 training samples were created with the reference pixels of 50.13 percent for water bodies and 49.87 percent for other features. The confusion matrix was generated using a distinct set of 500 random points for each classification technique, and the F-score and kappa coefficient were calculated for the accuracy assessment. The study depicts that the supervised algorithms, Support Vector Machine, Maximum Likelihood and Random Trees, and unsupervised algorithm, ISO Cluster perform equally in classifying water bodies and other features with higher kappa coefficient exceeding 0.95. Out of these, ISO Cluster was efficient than other algorithms due to reduced handling time. The findings enhance the decision-making ability on extracting surface water bodies using freely available 30 m spatial resolution imagery."

  abstract: "The mine environment is complex and highly dynamic due to the developments over time and surrounding climatic changes. Heedlessness to supply adequate quantity and quality of air will catalyse short and long-term ailments to the workers. Therefore, this study emerges as the new research frontier in incorporating software-assisted numerical simulation with analytical computations. This investigation assesses the existing ventilation parameters at the Bogala underground graphite mine for the propriety of the working environment. The uttermost bottom block between 240 and 275 fathoms (FM) levels was examined. The parameters were obtained through the in-field ventilation survey. Measured air quantity, psychometry, and air quality values were analysed and fed to the computer-simulated model. Moreover, the re-entry time for a development drive at 275 FM level was estimated using the throwback method. Adequacy assessment unveils that all the parameters besides air quality are inadequate at most stations for optimal mine conditions to attain maximum efficiency. Furthermore, the re-entry time after the development blast at the selected drive is meager and necessitates re-calculation for each blast. Moreover, stale air mixing and air recirculation are extant at 240 FM and 275 FM levels, respectively. Thus, mine ventilation at Bogala needs to be optimised, admitting workers' health, safety and comfort, and productivity of the mine."

  abstract: "Coal Fly Ash (CFA), a by-product of thermal power plant combustion, has a profound focus among researchers due to its pozzolanic properties, porosity, wide chemical composition, and thermal stability. While being suitable for many applications (e.g., pozzolanic material, soil stabiliser, and structural fill), CFA is also a potential precursor for synthesising zeolites, broadly used in wastewater treatment. However, pre-processing is crucial due to the heterogeneous nature of CFA. This work focused on pre-processing CFA prior to wastewater treatment through continuous washing cycles at various operating temperatures. To this end, we studied the pH and conductivity of the solution after washing over multiple cycles, Sauter mean diameter, and the mineralogy of the settled CFA. The gathered results were analysed and optimised through response surface methodology. This was done to find the best combination of the number of washing cycles and temperature to remove soluble ions and increase the surface area of CFA particles. The analytical outcome revealed that five washing cycles at 70°C were adequate, with minimal soluble ions and maximum surface area. Evidently, these findings demonstrated significant improvements in the physical and chemical properties of CFA as a precursor for zeolite synthesis. Therefore, we recommend further studies on this front to extend the effective usage of CFA for the synthesis of commercial zeolites to be used for wastewater treatment."

  #abstract: "Monitoring surface and near-shore water features is crucial for understanding dynamic environmental behaviours. Advances in satellite-based remote sensing have enabled the cost-effective and sustainable monitoring of water resources. Exploring the subclasses of water features using remote sensing requires further investigation. Spectral signatures have been proven to be effective in distinguishing water resource subclasses. Hence, this study aimed to establish the relationship between spectral signatures and the differentiation of water resource subclasses across wavelength ranges. To assess the effectiveness of the spectral signatures, a methodology combining the maximum difference and categorical matrices was used. This approach aims to compute an indicator matrix for quantitative evaluation. The indicator matrix quantifies the distinguishability between the classes across different wavelength ranges. These results facilitate the selection of optimal band combinations and wavelength ranges to delineate water subclasses efficiently. The findings of this study have practical implications for environmental and scientific applications, especially for classifying water resource subclasses."

  abstract: "Coal fly ash (CFA) is a highly versatile raw material that has the potential to yield multiple value-added products, including cenospheres, zeolites, carbon nanotubes, and fertiliser substrates. Despite its versatility, a majority of these components are often overlooked, and CFA is primarily used for construction. Conventional processing methods of CFA are known to pose significant environmental challenges, including the leaching of hazardous materials, emission of toxic gases, and the high energy consumption needed to extract the value-added components. Herein, we explore the potential of biometallurgical approaches as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional processing methods for the comprehensive utilisation of CFA. Our focus is on the application of different microorganisms to CFA, the domestication of microorganisms, preprocessing of CFA to facilitate effective biometallurgical processes, the use of bioreactors, and synthesis of nano silica particles. We also propose a novel method for extracting the value-added components from CFA using a preprocessing technique (i.e., washing cycle), combined with multiple interactions with biometallurgical processes. Adopting this approach, we not only enhance environmental stewardship but also improve the circular economic aspects of multi-component utilisation, while providing valuable insights for the development of sustainable techniques for utilising CFA."

  #abstract: "Response modes computed via linear resolvent analysis of a turbulent mean-flow field have been shown to qualitatively capture characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free shear flows.  To make such resolvent models predictive, the nonlinear forcing term must be closed. Strategies to do so include imposing self-consistent sets of triadic interactions, proposing various source models, or through turbulence modelling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the mean-field eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field.  In this study, a data-driven approach is taken to quantitatively improve linear resolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity field that maximizes the projection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent structure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations.  We use large-eddy simulation databases for round isothermal jets at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic conditions and show that the optimal eddy viscosity substantially improves the agreement between resolvent and SPOD modes, reaching over 90% agreement at those frequencies where the jet exhibits a low-rank response.  We then consider a fixed model for the eddy viscosity and show that with the calibration of a single constant, the results are generally close to the optimal one.  In particular, the use of a standard Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) eddy-viscosity resolvent model, with a single coefficient, provides substantial agreement between SPOD and resolvent modes for three turbulent jets and across the most energetic wavenumbers and frequencies."

  #abstract: "Three amplification mechanisms present in turbulent jets, namely lift-up, Kelvin– Helmholtz and Orr, are characterized via global resolvent analysis and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) over a range of Mach numbers. The lift-up mechanism was recently identified in turbulent jets via local analysis by Nogueira et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 873, 2019, pp. 211–237) at low Strouhal number (St) and non-zero azimuthal wavenumbers (m). In these limits, a global SPOD analysis of data from high-fidelity simulations reveals streamwise vortices and streaks similar to those found in turbulent wall-bounded flows. These structures are in qualitative agreement with the global resolvent analysis, which shows that they are a response to upstream forcing of streamwise vorticity near the nozzle exit. Analysis of mode shapes, component-wise amplitudes and sensitivity analysis distinguishes the three mechanisms and the regions of frequency–wavenumber space where each dominates, finding lift-up to be dominant as St/m → 0. Finally, SPOD and resolvent analyses of localized regions show that the lift-up mechanism is present throughout the jet, with a dominant azimuthal wavenumber inversely proportional to streamwise distance from the nozzle, with streaks of azimuthal wavenumber exceeding five near the nozzle, and wavenumbers one and two most energetic far downstream of the potential core."

  #abstract: "Linear resolvent analysis has demonstrated encouraging results for modeling coherent structures in jets when compared against their data-deduced counterparts from high-fidelity large-eddy simulations (LES). However, leveraging resolvent modes for reconstructing statistics of the far acoustic field remains elusive. In this study, we use a LES database to produce an ensemble of realizations for the acoustic field that we project on to a limited set of n resolvent modes. The projections are done on a restricted acoustic output domain, r/D = [5, 6], and allow for the LES realizations to be recast in the resolvent basis via a datadeduced, low-rank, n × n cross-spectral density matrix. We find substantial improvements to the acoustic field reconstructions with the addition of a RANS-derived eddy-viscosity model to the resolvent operator. The reconstructions quantitatively match the most energetic regions of the acoustic field across Strouhal numbers, St = [0 − 1], and azimuthal wavenumbers, m = [0, 2], using only three resolvent modes. Finally, the characteristics of the resulting n × n covariance matrices are examined and suggest off-diagonal terms may be neglected for n ≤ 3. Results are presented for round, isothermal, Mach 1.5 and 0.9 jets."
