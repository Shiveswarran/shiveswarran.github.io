  abstract: "The buildings demand a great amount of energy in their life cycle right from the extraction of raw materials to demolition stage. Hence, it is prudent to optimizing the energy embodied in the construction materials and needed to operate the building. The waste-based building materials will have very little embodied energy associate with and that is the energy needed for converting from the waste stage to the building material stage. One such material that is considered as a waste material is Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) used as a packaging material. Embodied Energy calculations were done according to ICE (Inventory of Carbon and Energy) data base and other relevant literature. The thermal performance of properly planned three storey apartment building has been assessed using Design Builder software to determine the energy associated with the operational phase to ensure adequate thermal comfort indoors. In Sri Lanka, Tropical uplands have low outdoor temperature distribution when compared to other climatic zones such as wet and dry lowland climates that can be ranked as warm humid. The energy (electricity) required for heating and lighting was obtained from Design Builder energy simulations. The passive techniques to minimize the heating energy demand such as: selecting the desirable orientation of the building, Window to Wall ratio, etc. have been analysed. With the data on embodied energy and the operational energy, a complete life cycle assessment which is a process-based, is carried out according to the ISO 14044:2006 standards using the OneClick LCA tool. A comparative study was undertaken to prove the suitability of EPS light weight panels for Tropical Upland Climate when compared with the other conventional construction materials such as bricks and concrete blocks. EPS panel apartment contributes about 20% energy savings in Embodied Energy: about 30% energy (electricity) savings in its Operational phase and about 40-50% environmental impact reduction when compared with conventional building materials."

  abstract: "The widespread use of location-enabled devices on public transportation vehicles produces a huge amount of geospatial data. The primary objective of this research study is to build a solution framework that can process a large amount of geospatial data obtained from GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers fixed on different buses on different routes, preprocess, clean, and transform that data for analysis. There are various challenges associated with the processing of GPS data, like discontinuities, non-uniformities, poor network coverage, and human errors. This study proposes two novel, simple algorithms to extract bus trip and bus stop sequences, from the crude raw data, incorporating those challenges. Moreover, the dwell times at the bus stops are estimated solely using this GPS data in three different possible scenarios in the data filtering process. When considering the previous related studies in this area, the proposed approaches are applied to GPS data obtained at a medium sample rate (for example, 15 seconds) for heterogeneous traffic conditions, and also with a unique dwell time estimation process. In addition, statistical methods are implemented to analyse a variety of novel public transit-system performance metrics, such as (i) excess journey time (EJT); (ii) excess dwelling time (EDT); (ii) excess running time (ERT); and (iv) segment idle time ratio (SITR), at different time horizons, where these metrics are developed in the absence of schedule data. These metrics facilitate the transport authorities in real-time bus monitoring, evaluating their performance, and identifying inappropriate driving behaviours. A detailed explanation is provided through a case study of two main routes in the Kandy district of Sri Lanka."

  abstract: "An accurate and reliable arrival time prediction of buses to the next bus stops is a valuable tool for both passengers and operators. Existing studies have some limitations in bus travel time prediction. They focus little on three aspects such as heterogeneous traffic flow conditions, dwell time prediction and interpretation of explanatory variables. Consequently, we break down the prediction problem into sub-models for running time and dwell time prediction and incorporate a feature engineering framework that generates features related to the running bus, the prediction day, and immediate and historical time variations to capture heterogeneous traffic conditions. We propose a multi- model stacked generalisation ensemble model by leveraging the advantages of best-performing models in homogeneous conditions such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) models. It outperformed the state-of-the-art models by 11% in mean absolute error (MAE) on average. It can predict extreme conditions in bus journeys more accurately. When interpreting the feature importance, we found insights like driver behaviour and preceding travel time influence the prediction model, which paves the way for strategic management by authorities."

  #abstract: "Coal Fly Ash (CFA), a by-product of thermal power plant combustion, has a profound focus among researchers due to its pozzolanic properties, porosity, wide chemical composition, and thermal stability. While being suitable for many applications (e.g., pozzolanic material, soil stabiliser, and structural fill), CFA is also a potential precursor for synthesising zeolites, broadly used in wastewater treatment. However, pre-processing is crucial due to the heterogeneous nature of CFA. This work focused on pre-processing CFA prior to wastewater treatment through continuous washing cycles at various operating temperatures. To this end, we studied the pH and conductivity of the solution after washing over multiple cycles, Sauter mean diameter, and the mineralogy of the settled CFA. The gathered results were analysed and optimised through response surface methodology. This was done to find the best combination of the number of washing cycles and temperature to remove soluble ions and increase the surface area of CFA particles. The analytical outcome revealed that five washing cycles at 70Â°C were adequate, with minimal soluble ions and maximum surface area. Evidently, these findings demonstrated significant improvements in the physical and chemical properties of CFA as a precursor for zeolite synthesis. Therefore, we recommend further studies on this front to extend the effective usage of CFA for the synthesis of commercial zeolites to be used for wastewater treatment."
